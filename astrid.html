		<h1>TV shows</h1>
		<p>In Riders and Defenders of Berk, the people of Berk were still learning to live among the dragons, with one resident Mildew being aggressively against this. So, Hiccup and his friends created the Berk Dragon Training Academy to continue training dragons and learning more about them. They are also in odds with some of Berk's enemies, including Alvin the Treacherous and Dagur the Deranged.<br>
		In Race to the Edge, it is three years since Dagur's defeat, but he escaped, leading Hiccup and the gang to try to catch him. While they were not able to, Hiccup does discover a device called the Dragon Eye, which holds information of many dragons. With this newfound inspiration to discover these secrets, Hiccup and his friends leave Berk and began to live at Dragon's Edge, while finding new dragons, as well as new enemies such as Dagur (temporarily) and Viggo Grimborn.</p>
