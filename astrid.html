		<p><b>Astrid's Story</b></p>
	</div>
	<div class="info2">
		<h1>Early Life</h1>
		<p></p>
		<h1>How to Train Your Dragon</h1>
		<p>At the beginning of the first movie, Astrid was part of a gang, helping putting fires out during Dragon Raids. She has the respect from others Vikings, being already considered a Viking warrior. While she hangs out with Snotlout, Fishlegs, Ruffnut and Tuffnut, she doesn't contribute to the mockery of Hiccup.<br>
		<br>
		She, along with the rest, joined Dragon Training where she was shown to be very capable, knowing what to do when encountering a Gronkle. While in the Great Hall, while the others mock Hiccup for his involvement, she gave constructive critisium, wanting him to know his mistakes. Despite this, she doesn't show any interest in him, immediately leaving him with the Book of Dragon when asked if she wanted to read with him.<br>
		<br>
		During one Dragon Training where the gang were fighting a Deadly Nadder, she once again comes out on top. However, when Hiccup gets in her way, she shouts at him, telling him to figure out what side he's on. That night, whle listenin to one of Gobber's stories, she noticed tht Hiccup left early, which made her curious.<br>
		<br>
	    While fighting a Hideous Zippleback in Dragon Training, she, along with the rest, were shocked at Hiccup's ability to get the dragon back into its cage. From that point on, he contiuned to improve and gain everyone's respect, which made Astrid jealous and curious at how he managed to do it. Astrid and Hiccup became the only students left who would kill the Monstrous Nightmare, which would be determined by facing a Gronkle. Despite her best attempts, Hiccup wins the honour.<br>
	    <br>
	    Her rage caused her to follow Hiccup afterwards to find out how he was able to get good so quickly. It was there where she first met Toothless, and realising Hiccup became friends with him, she ran off to tell the Vikings. However, she gets snatched up by them, who take her to a tree. Hiccup asked her a chance for him to explain, to which she reluctantly agreed. It doesn't start well, but once she apologised, the flight became calmer and more pleasnt, leading Astrid to accept Toothless.<br>
	    <br>
	    This flight is cut short when Toothless flies Hiccup and Astrid in the Dragon's Nest, where they seE The Red Death for the first time. She figured out how the smaller dragons have to fead the Red Death. She was about to tell the village, but Hiccup stopped, fearing about what would happen to Toothless. Surprised and impressed at his devotion towards the Night Fury, she agreed not to and left, but not before giving him a kiss on the check.<br>
	    <br>
	    The next day, Astrid watched as Hiccup faced the Monstrous Nightmare, witnessing him trying to show the Vikings the truth about dragons. But that doesn't go well, and she rushed in to help him, but she gets caught in the mayham before Stoick helped her to get her out. When Toothless emerged to save Hiccup and gets caught, she stopped Hiccup from interferring.<br>
	    <br>
	    She meets up with Hiccup later after Toothless is taking to find the Dragon's Nest. She tries to comfort him, asking him why he didn't kill Toothless, to which he answers that he couldn't because he saw himself in Toothless. This gave him the courage to save the tribe from the Red Death. Astrid brings the rest of the gang to help with Hiccup's plan, where she trains and flies a Deadly Nadder to the Dragon's Nest. After dropping Hiccup off to save Toothless, she helps distract the Red Death. However, she almost gets eaten by the dragon, but is saved by Hiccup and Toothless <br>
	    <br>
	    She then watched on from the ground as Hiccup and Toothless take the Red Death to the skies and then witnessed the dragon explode when it inpacted the ground. When it looked Hiccup didn't make it, she was on the verge of tears, but became delighted when he turned out he was alive. When Hiccup finally woke up, she punched him on the arm before kissing him. She then joined him as they flew high up in the sky.</p>
		<h1>TV shows</h1>
		<p>In Riders and Defenders of Berk, the people of Berk were still learning to live among the dragons, with one resident Mildew being aggressively against this. So, Hiccup and his friends created the Berk Dragon Training Academy to continue training dragons and learning more about them. They are also in odds with some of Berk's enemies, including Alvin the Treacherous and Dagur the Deranged.<br>
		<br>
		In Race to the Edge, it is three years since Dagur's defeat, but he escaped, leading Hiccup and the gang to try to catch him. While they were not able to, Hiccup does discover a device called the Dragon Eye, which holds information of many dragons. With this newfound inspiration to discover these secrets, Hiccup and his friends leave Berk and began to live at Dragon's Edge, while finding new dragons, as well as new enemies such as Dagur (temporarily) and Viggo Grimborn.</p>
