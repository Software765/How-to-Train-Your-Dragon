		<p><b>Hiccup's Story</b></p>
	</div>
	<div class="info2">
		<h1>Early Life</h1>
		<p>Hiccup was born early to Stoick the Vast and Valka. Because of this, he was given the name Hiccup. But when he was still a baby, Valka was kidnapped by a Stormcutter during a dragon attack, never to be seen again. When he was young boy, he had a close relationship with his father. However, as he got older, they started to grow apart, since it was clear he was smaller and skinner than the other Vikings.</p>
		<h1>How to Train Your Dragon</h1>
		<p>At the beginning of the first movie, Hiccup was an embarrassment, both to the tribe of Berk and to his father. He was a runt and not physical strong compared to other Vikings. However, he became very good at inventing things due to being Gobber's blacksmith apprentice. So much so, that during a regular dragon attack, he used one of his inventions and managed to shoot down a Night Fury, one of the most feared dragons. But doing this caused more chaos and no one believed him, so he let on his own to find the Night Fury. However, he couldn't kill him, so he lets him go.</p>
		<p>When he returned home, he found Stoick have entered him into Dragon Training, but Hiccup, realising he can't kill a dragon, doesn't want to go, but he had no choice. He entered Dragon Training, along with the other teenager Vikings, but doesn't do well. Hiccup then decides to find the Night Fury and began to form a bond with him, whom he later calls Toothless. Realising that Toothless can't fly without his left tailfin, which was lost during the attack, he decides to build a new one and help him again, eventually learning how to fly a dragon. Through his interactions with Toothless, Hiccup can excel in Dragon Training, impressing everyone, including his dad, but making fellow Viking, Astrid suspicious.</p>
		<p>After winning a chance to kill the final dragon, Hiccup planned to instead leave with Toothless, but is caught by Astrid and she finds out about Hiccup and Toothless. Hiccup stopped Astrid from telling the others, providing her a with romantic flight. But it's cut short when they discovered the dragon nest, with the dragons giving food a big dragon, the Red Death. Hiccup stopped Astrid from telling Stoick about the nest, fearing they would kill Toothless and told her to give him some time to think about it.</p>
		<p>At the final test, he is tasked to kill a Monstrous Nightmare, but doesn't and tried to show the Vikings that dragons are not bad creatures. But that doesn't go well, and the Monstrous Nightmare goes rampage. Luckily (and unluckily), Toothless came to rescue Hiccup, but in the process, makes his presence known and the Vikings capture him. During an argument with Hiccup and Stoick, Hiccup accidentally revealed that he found the Dragon Nest and that only a dragon could find it. He tried to stop Stoick and couldn't, gets shunned by him and witnessing the Viking sailing off, taking Toothless to find the Dragon Nest.</p>
		<p>During a talk with Astrid, he revealed why he couldn't kill Toothless to begin with - because he saw himself in Toothless. With that encouragement, he came up with a plan to help the teenage Vikings train dragons and go to the Dragon Nest. They all arrived there, just as the Red Death emerged from the mountains. While the team tried to slow the dragon down, Hiccup managed to rescue Toothless, along with Stoick who apologised to Hiccup.</p>
		<p>Hiccup and Toothless managed to get the Red Death to fly high in the clouds, culminating in Toothless firing a blast in its mouth, causing it to go up in flame. However, during the battle, Toothless' tailfin gets burned up and they are both knocked by the Red Death's tail, causing Hiccup to fall off Toothless and going unconscious. Luckily, Toothless managed to save him, gaining the respect from all the Vikings.</p>
		<p>Hiccup woke up about two weeks later, with Toothless by his side and in his house. But as he tried to get up, he found out that he had lost his left leg, with the leg being replaced with a prosthetic leg. With a bit of struggle and the help of Toothless, he left his house, finding out that Berk is now populated with dragons. All the Vikings were pleased to see Hiccup alright, with Stoick revealing that it was thanks to his son that made them realised dragon aren't all that bad after all.</p>
		<h1>TV shows</h1>
		<p>In Riders and Defenders of Berk, the people of Berk were still learning to live among the dragons, with one resident Mildew being aggressively against this. So, Hiccup and his friends created the Berk Dragon Training Academy to continue training dragons and learning more about them. They are also in odds with some of Berk's enemies, including Alvin the Treacherous and Dagur the Deranged.</p>
		<p>In Race to the Edge, it is three years since Dagur's defeat, but he escaped, leading Hiccup and the gang to try to catch him. While they were not able to, Hiccup does discover a device called the Dragon Eye, which holds information of many dragons. With this newfound inspiration to discover these secrets, Hiccup and his friends leave Berk and began to live at Dragon's Edge, while finding new dragons, as well as new enemies such as Dagur (temporarily) and Viggo Grimborn.</p>
