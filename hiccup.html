		<p><b>Hiccup's Story</b></p>
	</div>
	<div class="info2">
		<h1>Early Life</h1>
		<p>Hiccup was born early to Stoick the Vast and Valka. Because of this, he was given the name Hiccup. But when he was still a baby, Valka was kidnapped by a Stormcutter during a dragon attack, never to be seen again. When he was young boy, he had a close relationship with his father. However, as he got older, they started to grow apart, since it was clear he was smaller and skinner than the other Vikings.</p>
		<h1>How to Train Your Dragon</h1>
		<p>At the beginning of the first movie, Hiccup was an embarrassment, both to the tribe of Berk and to his father. He was a runt and not physical strong compared to other Vikings. However, he became very good at inventing things due to being Gobber's blacksmith apprentice. So much so, that during a regular dragon attack, he used one of his inventions and managed to shoot down a Night Fury, one of the most feared dragons. But doing this caused more chaos and no one believed him, so he let on his own to find the Night Fury. However, he couldn't kill him, so he lets him go.<br>
		When he returned home, he found Stoick have entered him into Dragon Training, but Hiccup, realising he can't kill a dragon, doesn't want to go, but he had no choice. He entered Dragon Training, along with the other teenager Vikings, but doesn't do well. Hiccup then decides to find the Night Fury and began to form a bond with him, whom he later calls Toothless. Realising that Toothless can't fly without his left tailfin, which was lost during the attack, he decides to build a new one and help him again, eventually learning how to fly a dragon. Through his interactions with Toothless, Hiccup can excel in Dragon Training, impressing everyone, including his dad, but making fellow Viking, Astrid suspicious.<br>
		After winning a chance to kill the final dragon, Hiccup planned to instead leave with Toothless, but is caught by Astrid and she finds out about Hiccup and Toothless. Hiccup stopped Astrid from telling the others, providing her a with romantic flight. But it's cut short when they discovered the dragon nest, with the dragons giving food a big dragon, the Red Death. Hiccup stopped Astrid from telling Stoick about the nest, fearing they would kill Toothless and told her to give him some time to think about it.<br>
		At the final test, he is tasked to kill a Monstrous Nightmare, but doesn't and tried to show the Vikings that dragons are not bad creatures. But that doesn't go well, and the Monstrous Nightmare goes rampage. Luckily (and unluckily), Toothless came to rescue Hiccup, but in the process, makes his presence known and the Vikings capture him. During an argument with Hiccup and Stoick, Hiccup accidentally revealed that he found the Dragon Nest and that only a dragon could find it. He tried to stop Stoick and couldn't, gets shunned by him and witnessing the Viking sailing off, taking Toothless to find the Dragon Nest.<br>
		During a talk with Astrid, he revealed why he couldn't kill Toothless to begin with - because he saw himself in Toothless. With that encouragement, he came up with a plan to help the teenage Vikings train dragons and go to the Dragon Nest. They all arrived there, just as the Red Death emerged from the mountains. While the team tried to slow the dragon down, Hiccup managed to rescue Toothless, along with Stoick who apologised to Hiccup.<br>
		Hiccup and Toothless managed to get the Red Death to fly high in the clouds, culminating in Toothless firing a blast in its mouth, causing it to go up in flame. However, during the battle, Toothless' tailfin gets burned up and they are both knocked by the Red Death's tail, causing Hiccup to fall off Toothless and going unconscious. Luckily, Toothless managed to save him, gaining the respect from all the Vikings.<br>
		Hiccup woke up about two weeks later, with Toothless by his side and in his house. But as he tried to get up, he found out that he had lost his left leg, with the leg being replaced with a prosthetic leg. With a bit of struggle and the help of Toothless, he left his house, finding out that Berk is now populated with dragons. All the Vikings were pleased to see Hiccup alright, with Stoick revealing that it was thanks to his son that made them realised dragon aren't all that bad after all.</p>
		<h1>TV shows</h1>
		<p>In Riders and Defenders of Berk, the people of Berk were still learning to live among the dragons, with one resident Mildew being aggressively against this. So, Hiccup and his friends created the Berk Dragon Training Academy to continue training dragons and learning more about them. They are also in odds with some of Berk's enemies, including Alvin the Treacherous and Dagur the Deranged.<br>
		In Race to the Edge, it is three years since Dagur's defeat, but he escaped, leading Hiccup and the gang to try to catch him. While they were not able to, Hiccup does discover a device called the Dragon Eye, which holds information of many dragons. With this newfound inspiration to discover these secrets, Hiccup and his friends leave Berk and began to live at Dragon's Edge, while finding new dragons, as well as new enemies such as Dagur (temporarily) and Viggo Grimborn.</p>
		<h1>How to Train Your Dragon 2</h1>
		<p>At the beginning of the film, it had been five years since Vikings and Dragons have been living together. Hiccup had been flying with Toothless, exploring and discoving many new islands. He also been pressured by Stoick to become the next Chief, despite not feeling ready for it. During one discovery, Hiccup and Toothless, along with Astrid and Stormfly, discovered the destoryed fort, covered in ice, while also meeting Eret, Son of Eret, who told them about Drago Bludvist, a warlord who is creating a dragon army.<br>
		Hiccup and Astrid returned to Berk, where Hiccup told his father about Drago, which caused hiim to immediately bring Berk on lockdown. Despite being told that Drago is a madman, Hiccup believed he can convince Drago to stop all this and travelled to Eret's ship, along with Astrid, to meet with Drago. However, he was found by Stoick and his friends, where Stoick further explained by Drago is a dangerous person. However, Hiccup is still convinced he can change Drago's mind and left with Toothless to find him.<br>
		While travelling, Hiccup and Toothless came across a mysterious dragon rider, riding on the back of a Stormcutter. They grabbed Hiccup, causing Toothless to fall in the frozen ocean. Hiccup is taken to a place, full of dragons, where he was able to train him easily. He was also reunited with Toothess, where the mystery dragon rider was revealed to be Valka, his long lost mother.<br>
		Hiccup learnt that Valka had been living among dragons, living in a dragon sanctuary for 20 years, which is the home of the Bewilderbeast, an alpha species. Through their shared love for dragons, they bonded again. However, Hiccup learnt that like Stoick, Valka was not willing to reason with Drago.<br>
		Before he left the sanctuary to find Drago, he was found by Stoick and Gobber, but Hiccup managed to get Stoick to see Valka again. There, he witnessed his parents bonding again, with Valka agreeing to return to Berk. However, the sanctuary is attacked by Drago and his men, whom also brought another Bewilderbeast. Hiccup took his chance to try and reason with him, but it doesn't work. This led Drago to let his Bewilderbeast control Toothless to kill Hiccup, but Stoick took the blast, killing him instead.<br>
		Hiccup and the gang held a funeral for Stoick, where Hiccup shared his fear of becoming Chief. However, with words of encouragement from his mother, he was determined to conitune Stoick's legacy and stop Drago. The gang returned to Berk on the back of baby Scutterclaws, where Hiccup was able to break Toothless free from the Bewilderbeast's control. They both separated Drago and the Bewilderbeast, but Hiccup got blasted by ice. However, Toothless rescued him and challeneged the alpha, freeing the other dragons and defeated it, therefore becoming the new alpha. Hiccup, himself, became the new Chief, succeding his father. He was now preparing to defend Berk at all cost, knowing they have dragons on their side.</p>

		<p><b>Main Relationships</b></p>
	</div>
	<div class="info4">
		<h1>Toothless</h1>
		<p>Toothless is Hiccup's dragon and best friend, having a brotherly relationship. This friendship didn't start on the right path, with Hiccup shooting the Night Fury down, causing the dragon to lose his left tailfin. But they soon start to bond with one another, with Hiccup deciding to help Toothless fly again, which led to him learning to fly on the back of a dragon.<br>
		They develop a strong friendship with each other, each wanting to protect the other. For instane, when Hiccup got attacked by a Monstrous Nightmare during his final exam, Toothless left the cove that kept him safe to save Hiccup.Their friendship only seemed to stengthen in th second movie, so much so that in the second movie, Hiccup was able to break Toothless free from his control from the Bewilderbeast.<br>
		Hiccup's attempt to create a Dragon-Viking uptopia on Berk in the third movie seemed from his desire to protect Toothless and to make sure nothing bad happens to him. Sadly though, it was his love for Toothless that allowed him to make the most difficult decision - letting him go and to be free.But despite this, their friendship remained strong, that they still remembered each other when they were older.</p>
		<h1>Stoick the Vast</h1>
		<p>Stoick the Vast is Hiccup's father and the Chief of Berk. At first, their relationship was quite strained, due to the both of them being very different - Stoick was large and strong whereas Hiccup was lanky and weak. But it took the events of the first movie for Stoick to finally accept for who he is.<br>
		Their relationship started to improve, but they would still have some disagreement with each other. But despite this, they both respect with each other<br>
		In the second movie, Stoick became so proud of his son that he wanted him to become Chief, but Hiccup doesn't feel ready. This, in a way, caused another strained in their relationship, especially when they disagree how to approach the situation of Drago.<br>
		Despite these strained relationships, it was clear that both cared for each other. Stoick was very protective towards Hiccup, to the point that he was willing to sacrifice himself from a controlled Toothless. Hiccup had a great respect for his father, which was the reason why he wanted to impress him in the first film. Because of this, he was willing to become Chief and contiune his legacy</p>
		<h1>Astrid Hofferson</h1>
		<p>Astrid is Hiccup's love interest and later girlfriend. At first, she didn't seemed to be interested in Hiccup, only focusing of her training. While she doesn't mock him like the other teens, she didn't think much of him either. When Hiccup to gain an upper hand in Dragon Training, it made her jealous, so she followed him to find out about Toothless. At first, she was appalled and was ready to tell the village about this. But her mind changed after a fly about with Hiccup and revealing how much he cared for Toothless.<br>
		From that moment on, she began to be more supportive of him, first encouraging him when Toothless was taken to be used to find the Dragon Nest. She was clearly upset when she thought Hiccup was dead after the Red Death battle, before being happy when he was alive. So much so, she gave a him a kiss when he woke up.<br>
		Despite that kiss, in the Riders and Defenders of Berk, both are shown to have only a friendship, but Astrid would still support Hiccup and both would rescue each other from danger. It was in Race to the Edge where they would start to be in a romantic relationship, which would ultimately lead to them being betrothed.<br>
		Their relationship contiuned in the second and third movie, where they were both playfully with one another, as well as supporting each other.</p>
		<h1>Valka</h1>
		<p>Valka is Hiccup's mother. She was presumed dead when he was only a baby, so he didn't have a relationship with her until twenty years later in the second film.<br>
		Even though they hadn't been together for so long, they managed to connect with one another due to their shared belief in dragons. Because of this, Valka was willing to return to Berk, feeling guilty about staying away from Hiccup. Hiccup does seemed to forgive her for this, showing a clear love for her.</p>
